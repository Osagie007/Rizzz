# Rizzz Gadgets Ecommerce site


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Python
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Python web-framework library


### What I learned

I learned a bit more on creating eccommerce site from scratch. The front-end part of the project was inspired by the work of popular youtube programmer 
Dennis Ivy

```html
<div class="container">
        <br />
        {% block content %} {% endblock content %}
    </div>
```
```css
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6{
	color:hsl(0, 0%, 30%);
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
```py
def processOrder(request):
    transaction_id = datetime.datetime.now().timestamp()
    data = json.loads(request.body)
```

### To run
```shell
python manage.py
```

### Continued development

I really want to improve on python and javascript. Django is also a priority. Hopefully i will be as good as i want in the near future.

### Useful resources

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Their Documentation is pretty neat and straight forward
